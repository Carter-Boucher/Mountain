## Render mountain terrain using a 2D Perlin Noise function

This project is a simple implementation of a 2D Perlin Noise function to render mountain terrain. The Perlin Noise function is a widely used algorithm to generate natural-looking textures. It was developed by Ken Perlin in 1983 and has been used in many applications, including computer graphics, procedural content generation, and simulations.
