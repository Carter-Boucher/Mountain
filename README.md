## Render mountain terrain using Perlin Noise

This project implements a 2D Perlin Noise function to render mountain terrain.
The Perlin Noise function is a widely used algorithm to generate natural-looking textures.
It was developed by Ken Perlin in 1983 and has been used in many applications,
including computer graphics, procedural content generation, and simulations.

Graphics are done in pure c++ and openGL.
